## General

This project was done at the end of our first year at Epitech. The goal was to make a complete RPG game. We can choose the story and the theme we want. Finally, we chose the universe of Diablo.

## Technical

The language used is C. We used a library called CSFML, which is a graphical C++ library converted to C for this purpose.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sn00ww/my_rpg

make
./my_rpg
